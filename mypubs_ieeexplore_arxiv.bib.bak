  abstract  = {Massive MIMO systems are highly efficient but critically rely on accurate channel state information (CSI) at the base station in or-der to determine appropriate precoders. CSI acquisition requires sending pilot symbols which induce an important overhead. In this paper, a method whose objective is to determine an appropriate precoder from the knowledge of the user’s location only is proposed. Such a way to determine precoders is known as location based beamforming. It allows to reduce or even eliminate the need for pilot symbols, depending on how the location is obtained. the proposed method learns a direct mapping from location to pre-coder in a supervised way. It involves a neural network with a specific structure based on random Fourier features allowing to learn functions containing high spatial frequencies. It is assessed empirically and yields promising results on realistic synthetic channels. As opposed to previously proposed methods, it allows to handle both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.},

abstract={Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems have a huge potential both in terms of data rate and energy efficiency, although channel estimation becomes challenging for a large number of antennas. Using a physical model allows to ease the problem by injecting a priori information based on the physics of propagation. However, such a model rests on simplifying assumptions and requires to know precisely the configuration of the system, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper we present mpNet, an unfolded neural network specifically designed for massive MIMO channel estimation. It is trained online in an unsupervised way. Moreover, mpNet is computationally efficient and automatically adapts its depth to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method we propose adds flexibility to physical channel models by allowing a base station (BS) to automatically correct its channel estimation algorithm based on incoming data, without the need for a separate offline training phase. It is applied to realistic millimeter wave channels and shows great performance, achieving a channel estimation error almost as low as one would get with a perfectly calibrated system. It also allows incident detection and automatic correction, making the BS resilient and able to automatically adapt to changes in its environment.},

abstract={Channel charting is an unsupervised learning task whose objective is to encode channels so that the obtained representation reflects the relative spatial locations of the corresponding users. It has many potential applications, ranging from user scheduling to proactive handover. In this letter, a channel charting method is proposed, based on a distance measure specifically designed to reduce the effect of small scale fading, which is an irrelevant phenomenon with respect to the channel charting task. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique aimed at preserving local distances (Isomap) is then applied to actually get the channel representation. The approach is empirically validated on realistic synthetic multipath MIMO channels, achieving better results than previously proposed approaches, at a lower cost.},

abstract={In a wireless network, gathering information at the base station about mobile users based only on uplink channel measurements is an interesting challenge. Indeed, accessing the users locations and predicting their downlink channels would be particularly useful in order to optimize the network efficiency.

It relies on a labeled database that can be acquired in a simple way by the base station while operating.

year={2020},

abstract={Channel estimation is of paramount importance in most communication systems in order to optimize the data rate/energy consumption tradeoff. In modern systems, the possibly large number of transmit/receive antennas and subcarriers makes this task difficult. Designing pilot sequences of reasonable size yielding good performance is thus critical. Classically, the number of pilots is reduced by viewing the channel as a random vector and assuming knowledge of its distribution. In practice, this requires estimating the channel covariance matrix, which can be computationally costly and not adapted to scenarios with high mobility. In this paper, an alternative view is considered, in which the channel is a function of unknown deterministic parameters. In this setting, the problem of designing optimal pilot sequences of smallest possible size is studied for any parametric channel model. To do so, the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for this general channel estimation problem is given, highlighting its key dependency on the introduced variation space. Then, the minimal size of pilot sequences and minimal value of the CRB are determined. Moreover, a general strategy to build optimal minimal length power constrained pilots sequences is given, based on an estimation of the variation space. The theoretical results are finally illustrated in a massive MIMO system context. They conveniently allow to retrieve well known previous results, but also to exhibit minimal length optimal pilot sequences for a new strategy based on a nonlinear physical model.},

pages={32434-32452},
abstract={Exploiting massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains come at the expense of obtaining accurate channel estimates at the base station. However, conventional channel estimation techniques do not scale well with increasing number of antennas and incur an unacceptably large training overhead in many applications. This calls for training designs and channel estimation techniques that efficiently exploit the physical properties of the massive MIMO channel as captured by sophisticated system/channel models. In this paper, we present designs that exploit the sparsity of the angle and delay domain representation of the massive MIMO channel as well as the low-rank property of the channel covariance, while also providing the connection between the sparse angle-delay representation and low-rank covariance property. Numerous multiuser scenarios are investigated including uplink, downlink, and single-and multi-cell communications, with the designs aiming at minimizing the channel estimation error or maximizing achievable rates with reduced training overhead. Theoretical analysis and numerical performance results indicate significant reduction of training overhead over conventional techniques while achieving similar performance. The presented methods demonstrate the importance of exploiting fundamental channel properties and reveal important insights on the interplay/tradeoff between training overhead and performance that can serve as guidelines for the design of future massive MIMO communication systems.},

abstract={The fast Fourier transform is an algorithm of paramount importance in signal processing as it allows to apply the Fourier transform in $\mathcal {O}(n \log n)$ instead of $\mathcal {O}(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. Graph signal processing is a recent research domain that generalizes classical signal processing tools, such as the Fourier transform, to situations where the signal domain is given by any arbitrary graph instead of a regular grid. Today, there is no method to rapidly apply graph Fourier transforms. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain approximate graph Fourier transforms that can be applied rapidly and stored efficiently. It is based on a greedy approximate diagonalization of the graph Laplacian matrix, carried out using a modified version of the famous Jacobi eigenvalues algorithm. The method is described and analyzed in detail, and then applied to both synthetic and real graphs, showing its potential.},

The truncation parameter, J, represents a trade-off between precision of the transform and time of computation (and storage space). We explore further this trade-off and study, on different types of graphs, how is the approximation error distributed along the spectrum.},

First, given the text, we propose to produce a speech example via either a speech synthesizer or a human. We then use this example to guide source separation and, for that purpose, we introduce a new variant of the nonnegative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) model based on a so called excitation-filter-channel speech model. The proposed NMPCF model allows sharing the linguistic information between the example speech and the speech in the mixture. We then derive the corresponding multiplicative update (MU) rules for the parameter estimation. Experimental results over different types of mixtures and speech examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this paper we present a novel text-informed framework in which a target speech source can be separated from the background in the mixture using the corresponding textual information. First, given the text, we propose to produce a speech example via either a speech synthesizer or a human. We then use this example to guide source separation and, for that purpose, we introduce a new variant of the non-negative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) model based on a so-called excitation-filter-channel speech model. Such a modeling allows sharing the linguistic information between the speech example and the speech in the mixture. The corresponding multiplicative update (MU) rules are eventually derived for the parameters estimation and several extensions of the model are proposed and investigated. We perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of source separation and alignment performance.},

  abstract      = {The reconfigurability of radio environments with programmable metasurfaces is considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. Identifying suitable metasurface configurations for desired wireless functionalities requires a precise setting-specific understanding of the intricate impact of the metasurface configuration on the wireless channels. Yet, to date, the relevant short and long-range correlations between the meta-atoms due to proximity and reverberation are largely ignored rather than precisely captured. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a compact model derived from first physical principles can precisely predict how wireless channels in complex scattering environments depend on the programmable-metasurface configuration. The model is calibrated using a very small random subset of all possible metasurface configurations and without knowing the setup's geometry. Our approach achieves two orders of magnitude higher precision than a deep learning-based digital-twin benchmark while involving hundred times fewer parameters. Strikingly, when only phaseless calibration data is available, our model can nonetheless retrieve the precise phase relations of the scattering matrix as well as their dependencies on the metasurface configuration. Thereby, we achieve coherent wave control (focusing or enhancing absorption) and phase-shift-keying backscatter communications without ever having measured phase information. Finally, our model is also capable of retrieving the essential properties of scattering coefficients for which no calibration data was ever provided. These unique generalization capabilities of our pure-physics model significantly alleviate the measurement complexity. Our approach is also directly relevant to dynamic metasurface antennas, microwave-based signal processors as well as emerging in situ reconfigurable nanophotonic, optical and room-acoustical systems.},

  abstract      = {Modern communication systems rely on accurate channel estimation to achieve efficient and reliable transmission of information. As the communication channel response is highly related to the user's location, one can use a neural network to map the user's spatial coordinates to the channel coefficients. However, these latter are rapidly varying as a function of the location, on the order of the wavelength. Classical neural architectures being biased towards learning low frequency functions (spectral bias), such mapping is therefore notably difficult to learn. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper presents a frugal, model-based network that separates the low frequency from the high frequency components of the target mapping function. This yields an hypernetwork architecture where the neural network only learns low frequency sparse coefficients in a dictionary of high frequency components. Simulation results show that the proposed neural network outperforms standard approaches on realistic synthetic data.},

This potentially yields a dramatic reduction of the overhead due to channel estimation or beam management, since only the base station performing charting requires channel state information, the others directly predicting the beam from the chart location.

It is possible to perform SISO-OFDM channel estimation using sparse recovery techniques. However, this approach relies on the use of a physical wave propagation model to build a dictionary, which requires perfect knowledge of the system's parameters. In this paper, an unfolded neural network is used to lighten this constraint. Its architecture, based on a sparse recovery algorithm, allows SISO-OFDM channel estimation even if the system's parameters are not perfectly known. Indeed, its unsupervised online learning allows to learn the system's imperfections in order to enhance the estimation performance. The practicality of the proposed method is improved with respect to the state of the art in two aspects: constrained dictionaries are introduced in order to reduce sample complexity and hierarchical search within dictionaries is proposed in order to reduce time complexity. Finally, the performance of the proposed unfolded network is evaluated and compared to several baselines using realistic channel data, showing the great potential of the approach.},

In this paper, we propose a model-driven learning architecture for joint single-target multi-input multi-output (MIMO) sensing and multi-input single-output (MISO) communication. We compare it with a standard neural network approach under complexity constraints. Results show that under hardware impairments, both learning methods yield better results than the model-based standard baseline.
