I am an associate professor in the electronics and telecommuniciations (E&T) department at the national institute of applied sciences ([INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/insa-rennes-2.html)), France. My research interests include signal processing, machine learning and applied mathematics for efficient and frugal wireless communication systems. For a brief introduction to my research activities, see this [talk](https://youtu.be/-m-QLP-fHQM).
