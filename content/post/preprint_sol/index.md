A new preprint entitled [**Experimentally realized physical-model-based wave control in metasurface-programmable complex media**]({{< ref "/publication/sol-2023-experimentally" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. This is a joint work with [Philipp del Hougne](https://sites.google.com/view/pdelhougne/home) and his team, in which a physical model is used to infer the channel parametrized by RIS configurations from a small subset of measured ones.
