A new preprint entitled [**Model-based Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Periodic Structures**]({{< ref "/publication/pololÃ³pez-2023-modelbased" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It shows that model-based learning using equivalent circuits can be leveraged to make the simulation of frequency selective surfaces (FSS) faster.
