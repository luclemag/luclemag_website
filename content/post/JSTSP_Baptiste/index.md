Our paper entitled [**Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping**]({{< ref "/publication/chatelier-2024-modelbasedlearningmultiantennamultifrequency" >}}) has just been accepted to the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics on Signal Processing ( [Editor link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924768)). It shows that a physically-inspired neural network can faithfully reconstruct channel responses in a given environment with a reasonable number of learnable weights. Congrats to Baptiste for this solid work!
