A new preprint entitled [**Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping**]({{< ref "/publication/chatelier-2024-modelbasedlearningmultiantennamultifrequency" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It shows that a physically-inspired neural network can faithfully reconstruct channel responses in a given environment with a reasonable number of learnable weights.
