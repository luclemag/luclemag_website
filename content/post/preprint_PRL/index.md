A new preprint entitled [**Optimal blind focusing on perturbation-inducing targets in sub-unitary complex media**]({{< ref "/publication/sol-2024-optimal" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. This is a joint work with [Philipp del Hougne](https://sites.google.com/view/pdelhougne/home) and his team, in which a physical model is used to perform conjugate beamforming without any pilot exchange.
