A new preprint entitled [**Model-based learning for joint channel estimation and hybrid MIMO precoding**]({{< ref "/publication/klaimi-2025-modelbased" >}}) just appeared on arXiv, and it has been accepted to SPAWC. In this paper, iterative algorithms are transformed into neural networks to adress jointly the tasks of channel estimation and precoding. Congratulations to Nay and Amira for this solid piece of work!
