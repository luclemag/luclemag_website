A new preprint entitled [**Model-based learning for location-to-channel mapping**]({{< ref "/publication/chatelier-2023-modelbased" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It shows that model-based learning using physical propagation models leads to better results than classical neural network on the mapping linking the location of a given user to its wireless channel.
