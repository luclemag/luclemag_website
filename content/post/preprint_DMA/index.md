A new preprint entitled [**Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation**]({{< ref "/publication/prodhomme-2025" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. This is a joint work with [Philipp del Hougne](https://sites.google.com/view/pdelhougne/home) and his team, in which a physical model is used to analyze the impact of mutual coupling on both the strength and simplicity of the configuration/radiation pattern mapping.
