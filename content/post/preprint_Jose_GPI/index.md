A new preprint entitled [**Unsupervised Learning for Gain-Phase Impairment Calibration in ISAC Systems**]({{< ref "/publication/mateosramos-2024-gaibphaseimpairment" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It is a collaboration with Henk Wymeersch's team at Chalmers University which shows that gain and phase impairments can be learnt in a unsupervised manner in the context of ISAC transceivers.
