A project for which I am the PI has been accepted for funding by the french national research agency (ANR), within the young researcher track (JCJC).

The MoBAIWL project (2024-2027, 300kâ‚¬) will aim at designing efficient data processing methods for future wireless
communication systems (6G and beyond), using physical models to structure, initialize and
train frugal artificial intelligence methods.
