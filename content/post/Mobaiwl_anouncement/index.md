The MoBAIWL project for which I am the PI has been accepted for funding by the french national research agency (ANR).

The MoBAIWL project (2024-2027) will aim at designing efficient data processing methods for future wireless
communication systems (6G and beyond), using physical models to structure, initialize and
train frugal artificial intelligence methods.

Job offers (intern/PhD/Postdoc) coming soon.
