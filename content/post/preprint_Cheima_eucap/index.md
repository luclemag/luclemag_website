A new preprint entitled [**Efficient Frequency Selective Surface Analysis via End-to-End Model-Based Learning**]({{< ref "/publication/hammami-2024-efficientfrequencyselectivesurface" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It shows that model-based learning can be used to predict an FSS response efficiently from its geometric parameters, taking advantage of an equivalent circuit representation. Congrats to Cheima for this solid work!
