A new preprint entitled [**Physically Parameterized Differentiable MUSIC for DoA Estimation with Uncalibrated Arrays**]({{< ref "/publication/chatelier-2024-physicallyparameterizeddifferentiablemusic" >}}) just appeared on arXiv. It is a collaboration with Henk Wymeersch's team at Chalmers University (Baptiste Chatelier works currently there) which shows that antenna impairments can be learnt while using a subspace method for source localization.
