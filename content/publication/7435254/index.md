abstract: The computational cost of many signal processing and machine learning techniques
  is often dominated by the cost of applying certain linear operators to high-dimensional
  vectors. This paper introduces an algorithm aimed at reducing the complexity of
  applying linear operators in high dimension by approximately factorizing the corresponding
  matrix into few sparse factors. The approach relies on recent advances in nonconvex
  optimization. It is first explained and analyzed in details and then demonstrated
  experimentally on various problems including dictionary learning for image denoising
  and the approximation of large matrices arising in inverse problems.
