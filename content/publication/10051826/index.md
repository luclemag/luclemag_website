abstract: Channel charting (CC) is an unsupervised learning method allowing to locate
  users relative to each other without reference. From a broader perspective, it can
  be viewed as a way to discover a low-dimensional latent space charting the channel
  manifold. In this paper, this latent modeling vision is leveraged together with
  a recently proposed location-based beamforming (LBB) method to show that channel
  charting can be used for mapping channels in space or frequency. Combining CC and
  LBB yields a neural network resembling an autoencoder. The proposed method is empirically
  assessed on a channel mapping task whose objective is to predict downlink channels
  from uplink channels.
