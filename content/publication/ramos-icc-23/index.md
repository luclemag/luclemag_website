abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned to be one of the
  pillars of 6G. However, 6G is also expected to be severely affected by hardware
  impairments. Under such impairments, standard model-based approaches might fail
  if they do not capture the underlying reality. To this end, data-driven methods
  are an alternative to deal with cases where imperfections cannot be easily modeled.
  In this paper, we propose a model-driven learning architecture for joint single-target
  multi-input multi-output (MIMO) sensing and multi-input single-output (MISO) communication.
  We compare it with a standard neural network approach under complexity constraints.
  Results show that under hardware impairments, both learning methods yield better
  results than the model-based standard baseline. If complexity constraints are further
  introduced, model-driven learning outperforms the neural-network-based approach.
  Model-driven learning also shows better generalization performance for new unseen
  testing scenarios.
