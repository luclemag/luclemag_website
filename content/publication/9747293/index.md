abstract: Massive MIMO systems are highly efficient but critically rely on accurate
  channel state information (CSI) at the base station in or-der to determine appropriate
  precoders. CSI acquisition requires sending pilot symbols which induce an important
  overhead. In this paper, a method whose objective is to determine an appropriate
  precoder from the knowledge of the user’s location only is proposed. Such a way
  to determine precoders is known as location based beamforming. It allows to reduce
  or even eliminate the need for pilot symbols, depending on how the location is obtained.
  the proposed method learns a direct mapping from location to pre-coder in a supervised
  way. It involves a neural network with a specific structure based on random Fourier
  features allowing to learn functions containing high spatial frequencies. It is
  assessed empirically and yields promising results on realistic synthetic channels.
  As opposed to previously proposed methods, it allows to handle both line-of-sight
  (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.
