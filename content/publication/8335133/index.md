abstract: The graph Fourier transform (GFT) is in general dense and requires O(n2)
  time to compute and O(n2) memory space to store. In this paper, we pursue our previous
  work on the approximate fast graph Fourier transform (FGFT). The FGFT is computed
  via a truncated Jacobi algorithm, and is defined as the product of J Givens rotations
  (very sparse orthogonal matrices). The truncation parameter, J, represents a trade-off
  between precision of the transform and time of computation (and storage space).
  We explore further this trade-off and study, on different types of graphs, how is
  the approximation error distributed along the spectrum.
