 abstract = {The graph Fourier transform (GFT) is in general dense and requires O(n2) time to compute and O(n2) memory space to store. In this paper, we pursue our previous work on the approximate fast graph Fourier transform (FGFT). The FGFT is computed via a truncated Jacobi algorithm, and is defined as the product of J Givens rotations (very sparse orthogonal matrices). The truncation parameter, J, represents a trade-off between precision of the transform and time of computation (and storage space). We explore further this trade-off and study, on different types of graphs, how is the approximation error distributed along the spectrum.},
