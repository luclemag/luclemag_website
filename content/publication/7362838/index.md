abstract: In this paper, we propose a technique to factorize any matrix into multiple
  sparse factors. The resulting factorization, called Flexible Approximate MUlti-layer
  Sparse Transform (FAμST), yields reduced multiplication costs by the matrix and
  its adjoint. Such a desirable property can be used to speed up iterative algorithms
  commonly used to solve high dimensional linear inverse problems. The proposed approach
  is first motivated, introduced and related to prior art. The compromise between
  computational efficiency and data fidelity is then investigated, and finally the
  relevance of the approach is demonstrated on a problem of brain source localization
  using simulated magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.
