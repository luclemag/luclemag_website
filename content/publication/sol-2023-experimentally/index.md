abstract: The reconfigurability of radio environments with programmable metasurfaces
  is considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. Identifying suitable
  metasurface configurations for desired wireless functionalities requires a precise
  setting-specific understanding of the intricate impact of the metasurface configuration
  on the wireless channels. Yet, to date, the relevant short and long-range correlations
  between the meta-atoms due to proximity and reverberation are largely ignored rather
  than precisely captured. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a compact model
  derived from first physical principles can precisely predict how wireless channels
  in complex scattering environments depend on the programmable-metasurface configuration.
  The model is calibrated using a very small random subset of all possible metasurface
  configurations and without knowing the setup's geometry. Our approach achieves two
  orders of magnitude higher precision than a deep learning-based digital-twin benchmark
  while involving hundred times fewer parameters. Strikingly, when only phaseless
  calibration data is available, our model can nonetheless retrieve the precise phase
  relations of the scattering matrix as well as their dependencies on the metasurface
  configuration. Thereby, we achieve coherent wave control (focusing or enhancing
  absorption) and phase-shift-keying backscatter communications without ever having
  measured phase information. Finally, our model is also capable of retrieving the
  essential properties of scattering coefficients for which no calibration data was
  ever provided. These unique generalization capabilities of our pure-physics model
  significantly alleviate the measurement complexity. Our approach is also directly
  relevant to dynamic metasurface antennas, microwave-based signal processors as well
  as emerging in situ reconfigurable nanophotonic, optical and room-acoustical systems.
