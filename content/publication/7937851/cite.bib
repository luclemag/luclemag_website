 abstract = {The fast Fourier transform is an algorithm of paramount importance in signal processing as it allows to apply the Fourier transform in $\mathcal O(n łog n)$ instead of $\mathcal O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. Graph signal processing is a recent research domain that generalizes classical signal processing tools, such as the Fourier transform, to situations where the signal domain is given by any arbitrary graph instead of a regular grid. Today, there is no method to rapidly apply graph Fourier transforms. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain approximate graph Fourier transforms that can be applied rapidly and stored efficiently. It is based on a greedy approximate diagonalization of the graph Laplacian matrix, carried out using a modified version of the famous Jacobi eigenvalues algorithm. The method is described and analyzed in detail, and then applied to both synthetic and real graphs, showing its potential.},
