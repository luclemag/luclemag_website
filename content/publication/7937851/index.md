abstract: The fast Fourier transform is an algorithm of paramount importance in signal
  processing as it allows to apply the Fourier transform in $mathcal O(n łog n)$ instead
  of $mathcal O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. Graph signal processing is a recent research
  domain that generalizes classical signal processing tools, such as the Fourier transform,
  to situations where the signal domain is given by any arbitrary graph instead of
  a regular grid. Today, there is no method to rapidly apply graph Fourier transforms.
  In this paper, we propose a method to obtain approximate graph Fourier transforms
  that can be applied rapidly and stored efficiently. It is based on a greedy approximate
  diagonalization of the graph Laplacian matrix, carried out using a modified version
  of the famous Jacobi eigenvalues algorithm. The method is described and analyzed
  in detail, and then applied to both synthetic and real graphs, showing its potential.
