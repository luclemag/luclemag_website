abstract: We consider a single-channel source separation problem consisting in separating
  speech from nonstationary background such as music. We introduce a novel approach
  called text-informed separation, where the source separation process is guided by
  the corresponding textual information. First, given the text, we propose to produce
  a speech example via either a speech synthesizer or a human. We then use this example
  to guide source separation and, for that purpose, we introduce a new variant of
  the nonnegative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) model based on a so called
  excitation-filter-channel speech model. The proposed NMPCF model allows sharing
  the linguistic information between the example speech and the speech in the mixture.
  We then derive the corresponding multiplicative update (MU) rules for the parameter
  estimation. Experimental results over different types of mixtures and speech examples
  show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
