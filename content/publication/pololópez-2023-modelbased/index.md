abstract: This work presents a deep learning surrogate model for the fast simulation
  of high-dimensional frequency selective surfaces. We consider unit-cells which are
  built as multiple concatenated stacks of screens and their design requires the control
  over many geometrical degrees of freedom. Thanks to the introduction of physical
  insight into the model, it can produce accurate predictions of the S-parameters
  of a certain structure after training with a reduced dataset.The proposed model
  is highly versatile and it can be used with any kind of frequency selective surface,
  based on either perforations or patches of any arbitrary geometry. Numeric examples
  are presented here for the case of frequency selective surfaces composed of screens
  with rectangular perforations, showing an excellent agreement between the predicted
  performance and such obtained with a full-wave simulator.
