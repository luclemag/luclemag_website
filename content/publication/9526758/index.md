abstract: Channel charting is an unsupervised learning task whose objective is to
  encode channels so that the obtained representation reflects the relative spatial
  locations of the corresponding users. It has many potential applications, ranging
  from user scheduling to proactive handover. In this letter, a channel charting method
  is proposed, based on a distance measure specifically designed to reduce the effect
  of small scale fading, which is an irrelevant phenomenon with respect to the channel
  charting task. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique aimed at preserving
  local distances (Isomap) is then applied to actually get the channel representation.
  The approach is empirically validated on realistic synthetic multipath MIMO channels,
  achieving better results than previously proposed approaches, at a lower cost.
