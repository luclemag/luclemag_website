abstract: In the context of a disturbance composed of a Low Rank (LR) clutter plus
  a white Gaussian noise, the corresponding LR filters used to detect a target embedded
  in this disturbance needs less training vectors than classical methods to reach
  equivalent performance. Unlike the classical one which is based on covariance matrix
  of the noise, the LR filter is based on the clutter subspace projector. In this
  paper, we propose a new estimator of the clutter subspace projector for a disturbance
  composed of a LR Spherically Invariant Random Vectors (SIRV) plus a zero mean white
  Gaussian noise that does not require prior information on the SIRV's texture. Numerical
  simulations validate the introduced estimator, and its performance and robustness
  are tested on a Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) simulation.
