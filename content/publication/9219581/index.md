abstract: This paper deals with the computation of integrals of centred bivariate
  Gaussian densities over any domain defined as an angular sector of ‚Ñù2 . Based on
  an accessible geometrical approach of the problem, we suggest to transform the double
  integral into a single one, leading to a tractable closed-form expression only involving
  trigonometric functions. This solution can also be seen as the angular cumulative
  distribution of bivariate centered Gaussian variables (X, Y). We aim to provide
  a didactic approach of our results, and we validate them by comparing with those
  of the literature.
