abstract: Channel charting is an unsupervised learning method that aims at mapping
  wireless channels to a so-called chart, preserving as much as possible spatial neighborhoods.
  In this paper, a model-based deep learning approach to this problem is proposed.
  It builds on a physically motivated distance measure to structure and initialize
  a neural network that is subsequently trained using a triplet loss function. The
  proposed structure exhibits a low number of parameters and clever initialization
  leads to fast training. These two features make the proposed approach amenable to
  on-the-fly channel charting. The method is empirically assessed on realistic synthetic
  channels, yielding encouraging results.
