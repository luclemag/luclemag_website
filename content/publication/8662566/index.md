abstract: Exploiting massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) gains come at the
  expense of obtaining accurate channel estimates at the base station. However, conventional
  channel estimation techniques do not scale well with increasing number of antennas
  and incur an unacceptably large training overhead in many applications. This calls
  for training designs and channel estimation techniques that efficiently exploit
  the physical properties of the massive MIMO channel as captured by sophisticated
  system/channel models. In this paper, we present designs that exploit the sparsity
  of the angle and delay domain representation of the massive MIMO channel as well
  as the low-rank property of the channel covariance, while also providing the connection
  between the sparse angle-delay representation and low-rank covariance property.
  Numerous multiuser scenarios are investigated including uplink, downlink, and single-and
  multi-cell communications, with the designs aiming at minimizing the channel estimation
  error or maximizing achievable rates with reduced training overhead. Theoretical
  analysis and numerical performance results indicate significant reduction of training
  overhead over conventional techniques while achieving similar performance. The presented
  methods demonstrate the importance of exploiting fundamental channel properties
  and reveal important insights on the interplay/tradeoff between training overhead
  and performance that can serve as guidelines for the design of future massive MIMO
  communication systems.
