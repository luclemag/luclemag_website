abstract: In a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication system, the multipath
  fading tends to vanish with increasing number of radio links. This well-known channel
  hardening phenomenon plays a central role in the design of massive MIMO systems.
  It is quantified by the coefficient of variation of the channel gain. The aim of
  this paper is to study channel hardening using a physical channel model in which
  the influences of propagation rays and antenna array topologies are highlighted.
  Our analyses and closed form results extend the hardening properties beyond the
  classical Rayleigh fading models and offer further insights on the relationship
  with channel characteristics.
