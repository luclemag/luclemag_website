abstract: Dictionary learning aims at finding a frame (called dictionary) in which
  some training data admits a sparse representation. Traditional dictionary learning
  is limited to relatively small-scale problems, because high-dimensional dense dictionaries
  can be costly to manipulate, both at the learning stage and when used for tasks
  such as sparse coding. In this paper, inspired by usual fast transforms, we consider
  a multi-layer sparse dictionary structure allowing cheaper manipulation, and propose
  a learning algorithm imposing this structure. The approach is demonstrated experimentally
  with a factorization of the Hadamard matrix and on image denoising.
